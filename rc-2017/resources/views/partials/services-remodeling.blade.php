      Our commitment to service and communication continues by assigning a personal project manager to your project. The project manager is your principal contact during the actual construction stage. With over 20 years of experience, your project manager has completed national construction code courses and is well-versed with all technical aspects of building systems and codes. The project manager coordinates each aspect of your home-improvement project in a logical, scheduled and organized fashion, anticipating complications before they happen and taking the necessary steps to avoid delay and unforeseen costs. With your own dedicated project manager, your project runs in a way that minimizes stress and allows you to enjoy the remodeling process.
